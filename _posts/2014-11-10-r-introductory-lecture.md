Find below the script for the short R-introduction I give during our advanced course in neuroscience. It is not really a lecture but more a collection of example code. I usually go through it line by lineÂ and the students bring their own laptops to play around with R at the same time. It contains general R basics and some short intro into plotting using the `ggplot()` function.

It is not heavily annotated but might still be helpful for some people.
