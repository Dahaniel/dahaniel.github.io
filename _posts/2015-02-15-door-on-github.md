A while ago I received a mail from Greg Jefferis who suggested to put the source code of our [DoOR database][1] on GitHub. We do provide the R packages on our homepage but via GitHub it would be easier for people to access and maybe even contribute to the code. I thought this was a great idea and I wanted to learn git anyways. With the help of a very good tutorial  I managed to setup two repositories for the [DoOR.data][2] and the [DoOR.functions][3] package in no time. Now it is easy for everybody who is interested to fork these projects or to follow the latest updates. The next step would be to think about whether it makes sense to release DoOR also via [CRAN][4].

So go and fork DoOR on GitHub!
