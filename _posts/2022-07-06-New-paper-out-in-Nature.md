I am excited to share that our story on *The neuronal logic of how internal states control food choice* [[^1]] is was published in Nature. [This link should give you free access](https://rdcu.be/cQ6Tr) to the paper. For an overview have a look at the [press release](https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/957829) or if you understand some German, listen to this [interview](https://www.deutschlandfunk.de/fruchtfliege-appetit-auf-die-richtigen-naehrstoffe-dlf-5f7aed67-100.html) I gave on German radio.
