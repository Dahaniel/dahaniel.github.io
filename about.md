On this webpage I want to give an overview over my research activities, hopefully in a way that also non-scientists will be able to get an idea about what I do and what I am interested in.

I am a neuroscientist, interested in different aspects of the sense of smell. I am fascinated by how even simple olfactory systems like that of the fruitfly _Drosophila_ are capable to to detect and interpret the incredible amount of complex chemical stimuli that surround us.

Furthermore I am interested in everything regarding open-source, open-access and tools for science communication in the internet, I love learning new techniques, may it be experimental procedures or data analysis and statistics. I perform most of my analysis in [Gnu-R][1].

Some of the projects I am currently working on relate to the creation and maintenance of [DoOR][2], the Database of Odor Responses, the [processing of chemical mixtures][3] in the olfactory periphery and the usage of insect antenna as chemical sensors, i.e. for the detection of cancer.
